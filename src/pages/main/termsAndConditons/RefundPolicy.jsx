                            Healthkard has a clear objective: to provide hassle-free access to Doctor consultations. Our main agenda is to create a single card, called Healthkard, that allows people to visit any of the Doctors associated with us for just 99 rupees. With Healthkard, the user won’t need to pay multiple consultation fees. You will get the unique Health Card ID for identifying the personal details of the user to prevent misuse, and with this unique ID, any doctor who is associated with Healthkard will be able to diagnose the user by knowing the previous medical history. We want to make healthcare affordable and accessible to all, so we’ve set a fixed price of 99 rupees for Doctor consultations. This way, we remove financial barriers and ensure that everyone can receive the care they need. Healthkard also encourages regular check-ups and preventive care. You can visit any doctor multiple times within the 28-days validity period. Our goal is to revolutionize the way people approach healthcare by providing a convenient and cost-effective solution. We want to empower individuals to prioritize their health and seek timely medical advice. So, if you want to visit a doctor in our country, we’re here to provide you with Healthkard.
